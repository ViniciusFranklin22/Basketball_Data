# Basketball Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project scrapes data from NBA and WNBA websites to analyze player performance, team standings, and other metrics. Using Python libraries for web scraping and data analysis, we will collect, process, and visualize data to answer key basketball-related questions and provide insights.

## Data Analysis
Using Pandas for data analysis, we discovered various insights, such as patterns in the draft and differences between the NBA and WNBA, helping us understand the evolution of the game. With the growth of the WNBA, especially due to new stars emerging from college, like Caitlin Clark, the league has attracted many new viewers. In this project, we conducted several analyses to begin understanding the league and compare it with NBA data. We standardized the information per minute, 48 minutes, or 100 possessions to help beginners, who may have only followed the NBA, better grasp the dynamics of the game, which is differentâ€”much like how FIBA basketball differs from the NBA.

## Data Processing
Inside the `NBA` folder, there is a file detailing how I processed the data, providing comprehensive information on the steps taken. Additionally, throughout the code, there are numerous comments explaining what was done.

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance understanding of both leagues and provide insights into player performance and team dynamics in basketball.
